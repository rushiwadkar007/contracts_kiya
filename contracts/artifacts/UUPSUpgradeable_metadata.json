The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy. A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades. The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism.",
